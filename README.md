https://juancamiloceron.medium.com/a-noob-approach-for-crisp-dm-that-probably-will-make-you-cry-d938bdb6f951

This project was created as part of a project evaluation for Udacity.

It aims to provide answers to certain questions for a given data set following the CRIPS DM approach. In this case the data set is a StackOverflow survey.

The questions were:
- What are the benefits that people who have been coding for the longest time enjoy the most? and, Does them change over the time?
- What are the skills a Developer think influence more the Salary, or in other words, the better paid?
- Apart of the Career satisfaction, what are other factors (implicit or explicit company factors) that influence Job Satisfaction?
